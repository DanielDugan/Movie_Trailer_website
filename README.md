# Movie_Trailer_website
Udacity Full Stack Project 1 Movie Trailer website. I have written server-side code to store a list of my favorite movies, including box art imagery and a movie trailer URL. I then used your code to generate a static web page allowing visitors to browse their movies and watch the trailers. 

The first component of this project is a list of lists of movie data is known humbly as Entertainment_center.py. The second component is the small but powerful media.py. Media.py gives general formatting and struture to the lists in Entertainment_center.py. Lastly, dd_fresh_tomatoes.py is the remix of fresh_tomatoes.py for those semi-lucky souls with a gaming laptop and a sore shoulder from carring it around. Fresh_tomatoes.py compiles the lists in Entertaimnent_center.py utilizing the structure of media.py to create a tidy .html file.

This project provides a python class to assemble arrays into a simple server-side script to generate a website. This projects specific focus was movies, but it can be manipulated to other media verticals.
