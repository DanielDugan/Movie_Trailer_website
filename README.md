# Movie_Trailer_website
Udacity Full Stack Project 1 Movie Trailer website. I have written server-side code to store a list of my favorite movies, including box art imagery and a movie trailer URL. I then subtly edited Allan Reyes' code to generate a static web page allowing visitors to browse their movies and watch the trailers. 

#### Running the Movie_Trailer_website program
0. Do you have python? If so, go to step one. If not, [download it here ](https://www.python.org/downloads/). This program was built in Python 2.7.9. If you need further assistance, feel free to reach out to me. Need great advice? Try out the [Nanodegrees at Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/nanodegree)
1. Download Entertainment_center.py, media.py and dd_fresh_tomatoes.py to your local machine and unzip them all into a folder named "It only took Daniel three tries to get the markdown text right". You can also feel free to name it something else the. The download link is on the main page on a github repo. [It is also here because I think you are awesome](https://github.com/Tvlistings/Movie_Trailer_website/archive/master.zip) 
2. Open the Python Gui (IDLE) from your system menu and open Entertainment_center.py from file. Take a moment review it. I assume my favorite movies are your favorite movies beacuse mine are the best movies ever. If you want to be wrong and choose other movies, you can follow the formatting from the great movies displayed. Here is the structure inside media.py (self, movie_title, movie_storyline, poster_image, trailer_youtube). 
3. Save you work (cntrl + S) and hit f5. A browser window should pop up with the greatest movies ever, or your version of that.
4. Bask in the glow of your wonderful work. If not, let me know and I will help you fix it.

The first component of this project is a list of lists of movie data is known humbly as Entertainment_center.py. The second component is the small but powerful media.py. Media.py gives general formatting and struture to the lists in Entertainment_center.py. Lastly, dd_fresh_tomatoes.py is the remix of fresh_tomatoes.py for those semi-lucky souls with a gaming laptop and a sore shoulder from carring it around. Fresh_tomatoes.py compiles the lists in Entertaimnent_center.py utilizing the structure of media.py to create a tidy .html file.

#####Entertainment_center.py
Entertainment_center.py was written by Daniel Dugan under the direction of Kunal Chawla for the Udacity Full Stack Project 1.

#####media.py  
media.py was written by Daniel Dugan under the direction of Kunal Chawla for the Udacity Full Stack Project 1

##### dd_fresh_tomatoes.py 
dd_fresh_tomatoes.py created by Allan Reyes and edited by Daniel Dugan (orginal was named fresh_tomatoes.py)

This project provides a python class to assemble arrays into a simple server-side script to generate a website. This projects specific focus was movies, but it can be manipulated to other media verticals.
